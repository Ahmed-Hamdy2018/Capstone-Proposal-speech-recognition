# Capstone-speech-recognition

## Intro:
Because of not dealing on a speech recognition problems, I decided to strengthen my
skills in such domain and work on a speech classification example that cover my need
for working in speech recognition tasks. In my project, I would like to build a radio
website that play a radio station and provide additional information below on the same
page about the speaker that is currently speaking on the radio.
I decided to focus this project in building a demo project that covers a simpler problem
than the final solution so I will just focus on building a speech classifier solution between
two speakers and I will increase it’s difficulty incrementally “Future Work”.

## Software Used:
You can use python 3 for coding files.

## Dataset Used:
You can find the full details about the dataset used through this link.
